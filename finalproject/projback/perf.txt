Statements used to create indexes:
IMPORTANT NOTE: these indexes were created with the reviews table having
100,000 rows, results will vary when using these commands with a smaller 
review table (for time purposes we have the number of rows to 10,000 instead
of 100,000).

create index col1_index_01 on review(rating); 
create index col1_index_02 on review(movieID); 

Queries that were affected by the indexes:
Query 1: "select avg(rating) from review where movieID = ?";
Query 2: "select * from review where movieID = ?";

Time consumption before and after adding the index. 
Time consumption Query 1: 
Before - 0.09 sec
After - 0.03 sec

Time consumption Query 2: 
Before - 0.15 sec
After - 0.04 sec
